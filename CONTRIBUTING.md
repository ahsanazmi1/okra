- Feature branches: Create from `phase-1-foundations`

### Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout phase-1-foundations
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes
3. Run tests and linting:
   ```bash
   pytest -q
   ruff check .
   black .
   ```

4. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

5. Push your branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. Create a Pull Request to `phase-1-foundations`

## Code Standards

### Python Style

- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write docstrings for public functions

### Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Aim for high test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commits format:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `test:` for test additions/changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks

## API Design

### MCP Protocol

When adding new MCP verbs:
1. Update `mcp/manifest.json` with new capabilities
2. Implement the verb in `mcp/server.py`
3. Add tests in `tests/`
4. Update documentation

### Credit Policies

When modifying credit policies:
1. Update `policies.py`
2. Add test cases in `tests/fixtures/`
3. Update API documentation
4. Consider backward compatibility

## Documentation

- Update README.md for significant changes
- Add docstrings to new functions
- Update CHANGELOG.md for user-facing changes
- Keep API documentation current

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your branch is up to date with `phase-1-foundations`
2. Run all tests and linting checks
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Provide a clear description of changes
5. Link any related issues

## Release Process
